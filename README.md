NoteBooks Statistics and Machine Learning
=========================================

Forked from leonvanbokhorst/NoteBooks-Statistics-and-MachineLearning

I've found these very useful over time, but most of the code no longer works with Pandas 1.x+ and Python 3.x+.
So decided to upgrade these.
Also expanding these a bit, with exercises that I did to better grasp the concepts.
